vim-slime
=========

Grab some text and "send" it to a [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) / [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) session.

    VIM ---(text)---> screen / tmux

Presumably, your screen contains something interesting like, say, a Clojure [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL). But if it can
receive typed text, it can receive it from vim-slime.

The reason you're doing this? Because you want the benefits of a REPL and the benefits of using Vim (familiar environment, syntax highlighting, persistence ...).

Read the [blog post](http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/).

Installation
------------

I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime.git

If you like it the hard way, copy plugin/slime.vim from this repo into ~/.vim/plugin.

Configuration (GNU Screen)
--------------------------

By default, GNU Screen is assumed, you don't have to do anything. If you want
to be explicit, you can add this line to your .vimrc:

    let g:slime_target = "screen"

Because Screen doesn't accept input from STDIN, a file is used to pipe data
between Vim and Screen. By default this file is set to `$HOME/.slime_paste`.
The name of the file used can be configured through a variable:

    let g:slime_paste_file = "$HOME/.slime_paste"

This file is not erased by the plugin and will always contain the last thing
you sent over. If this is a problem, I recommend you switch to tmux.

When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted for more configuration.

screen session name

    This is what you put in the -S flag, or one of the line of "screen -ls".

screen window name

    This is the window number or name, zero-based.

Configuration (tmux)
--------------------

Tmux is *not* the default, to use it you will have to add this line to your .vimrc:

    let g:slime_target = "tmux"

When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted for more configuration.

tmux socket name

    This is what you put in the -L flag, it will be "default" if you didn't put anything.

tmux target pane

    ":" means current window, current pane (a reasonable default)
    ":i" means the ith window, current pane
    ":i.j" means the ith window, jth pane
    "h:i.j" means the tmux session where h is the session identifier (either session name or number), the ith window and the jth pane 

By default `STDIN` is used to pass the text to tmux.
If you experience issues with this you may be able to work around them
by configuring slime to use a file instead:

    let g:slime_paste_file = "$HOME/.slime_paste"

This file is not erased by the plugin and will always contain the last thing
you sent over.  If this behavior is undesired one alternative is to use a temporary file:

    let g:slime_paste_file = tempname()

Key Bindings
------------

By default, the current paragraph will be sent. This is equivalent to typing *vip*. If you (visually) select text, that will be sent over:

    C-c, C-c  --- the same as slime
    
_You can just hold `Ctrl` and double-tap `c`._

There will be a few questions, as to where you want to send your text, and the answers will be remembered. If you need to reconfigure:

    C-c, v    --- mnemonic: "variables"
