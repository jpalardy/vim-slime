Grab some text and "send" it to a GNU Screen / tmux / whimrepl session.

	VIM ---(text)---> screen / tmux / whimrepl~

Presumably, your session contains a REPL, maybe Clojure, R or python. If you
can type text into it, vim-slime can send text to it.

The reason you're doing this? Because you want the benefits of a REPL and the
benefits of using Vim (familiar environment, syntax highlighting, persistence
...).

==============================================================================
1. Slime Usage 					*slime-usage*

						*CTRL-C_CTRL-C* *<c-c><c-c>*
<c-c><c-c>		Send the current paragraph text to screen/tmux/whimrepl.
			Slime will prompt for configuration if slime is not
			configured for the current buffer.

						*v_CTRL-C_CTRL-C* *v_<c-c><c-c>*
{Visual}<c-c><c-c>	Send highlighted text to screen/tmux/whimrepl.

<c-c>v			Setup slime to use screen, tmux or whimrepl. You will
:SlimeConfig		be prompted for information regarding how to target
			screen, tmux or whimrepl. See |slime-screen|,
			|slime-tmux| or |slime-whimrepl| for more information.

						*:SlimeSend*
:<range>SlimeSend	Send a [range] of lines to screen, tmux or whimrepl.
			If no range is provided the current line is sent.

                                                *:SlimeSend1*
:SlimeSend1 {text}      Send a single line of text, specified on the command
                        line, to screen, tmux, or whimrepl. A carriage return
                        is automatically appended.

                                                *:SlimeSend0*
:SlimeSend0 {text}      Send a single line of text, specified on the command
                        line, to screen, tmux, or whimrepl. This will not
			automatically append a carriage return.


==============================================================================
2. Screen Configuration 			*slime-screen*

By default, GNU Screen is assumed, you don't have to do anything. If you want
to be explicit, you can add this line to your |.vimrc|:
>
	let g:slime_target = "screen"
<
When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted
for more configuration.

Screen session name~

This is what you put in the -S flag, or one of the line of "screen -ls".

Screen window name~

This is the window number or name, zero-based.

==============================================================================
3. Tmux Configuration 				*slime-tmux*

Tmux is not the default, to use it you will have to add this line to your
|.vimrc|:
>
	let g:slime_target = "tmux"
<
When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted
for more configuration.

Tmux socket name~

This is what you put in the -L flag, it will be "default" if you didn't put
anything.

Tmux target pane~

A tmux pane can be targeted with any of the following values:
  - ":" means current window, current pane (a reasonable default)
  - ":i" means the ith window, current pane
  - ":i.j" means the ith window, jth pane
  - "h:i.j" means the tmux session where h is the session identifier
    (either session name or number), the ith window and the jth pane
  - "%i" means i refers the pane's unique id
  - "{token}" one of tmux's supported special tokens, like "{right-of}"

To get a list of all the available pane execute the following:
>
	tmux list-panes -a
<

Use bracketed-paste mode~

Sometimes REPL are too smart for their own good, e.g. autocompleting a bracket
that should not be autocompleted when pasting code from a file. In this case
it can be useful to rely on bracketed-paste
(https://cirw.in/blog/bracketed-paste). Luckily, tmux knows how to handle
that. See tmux's manual.

You can enable bracketed-paste using eiter
>
    g:slime_bracketed_paste
<
or
>
    b:slime_bracketed_paste
<

Note that the buffer variable takes precedence over the global's one.

for more configuration.

Zellij session id~

This is the id of the zellij session that you wish to target, the default value is "current" meaning the session containing the vim pane.
See e.g. the value of "zellij list-sessions" in the target window to figure out specific session names.

11. Vim :terminal Configuration 			*slime-vimterminal*

Vim :terminal support targets the terminal emulator built into vim from
version 8.0.0693, accessed via the :terminal command. It does not support the
neovim implementation of :terminal, which is instead supported by the separate
'neovim' target.

Vim :terminal is not the default, to use it you will have to add this line to
your |.vimrc|:
>
        let g:slime_target = "vimterminal"

Vim terminal configuration can be set by using the following in your .vimrc:

    let g:slime_vimterminal_config = {options}

for possible options, see help term_start()

You can specify if you have frequently used commands:
>
	let b:slime_vimterminal_cmd = "command"
<
or
>
	let g:slime_vimterminal_cmd = "command"
<
For example, if you use Python, set the following in your |.vimrc|:
>
	autocmd FileType python let b:slime_vimterminal_cmd='python3'
<
Note that the buffer variable takes precedence over the global one.

When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted
to select from an existing terminal or to create a new one.

==============================================================================
12. Slime Configuration 				*slime-configuration*

Global Variables~
						*g:slime_target*
g:slime_target		Set to either "screen" (default), "tmux" or "whimrepl".

						*g:slime_no_mappings*
g:slime_no_mappings	Set to non zero value to disable the default mappings.

						*g:slime_paste_file*
g:slime_paste_file	Required to transfer data from vim to GNU screen or
			tmux. Set to "$HOME/.slime_paste" by default. Setting
			this explicitly can work around some occasional
			portability issues. whimrepl does not require or
			support this setting.
						*g:slime_preserve_curpos*
g:slime_preserve_curpos	Set to non zero value to preserve cursor position when
			sending a line or paragraph. Default is 1.


						*g:slime_default_config*
g:slime_default_config	Set to dictionary of pre-filled prompt answer. See
			the README for details: https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime

						*g:slime_dont_ask_default*
g:slime_dont_ask_default	Works with g:slime_default_config. See
			the README for details: https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime

g:slime_bracketed_paste Set to non zero value to enable bracketed paste in
                        tmux. See |slime-tmux| or the README for details: 
                        https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime 

Mappings~

Slime's default mappings can be overridden by setting up mappings in your
|.vimrc| like so:
>
	xmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeRegionSend
	nmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend
<

The following special plugin mappings are provided by slime:

  Used by the default mappings:
  <Plug>SlimeRegionSend		Send {visual} text. Use |xmap|.
  <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend	Send a paragraph. Use |nmap|.
  <Plug>SlimeConfig		Call |:SlimeConfig|. Use |nmap|.

  Optional mappings:
  <Plug>SlimeLineSend		Send {count} line(s). Use |nmap|.
  <Plug>SlimeMotionSend		Send {motion}. Use |nmap|.

Disabling a mapping is as simple as creating a mapping that does not exist,
for example:
>
	nmap <Plug>NoSlimeParagraphSend <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend
<

To use vim like mappings instead of emacs keybindings use the following:
>
	let g:slime_no_mappings = 1
	xmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeRegionSend
	nmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeMotionSend
	nmap <leader>ss <Plug>SlimeLineSend
<

==============================================================================
13. Slime Requirements 				*slime-requirements*

Slime requires either screen or tmux to be available and executable. Awk is
used for completion of screen sessions.  whimrepl does not require any
executables, only that 'lein whimrepl' was used to start the Leiningen REPL.
