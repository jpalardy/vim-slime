Grab some text and "send" it to a GNU Screen / tmux session.

	VIM ---(text)---> screen / tmux~

Presumably, your screen contains something interesting like, say, a Clojure
REPL. But if it can receive typed text, it can receive it from vim-slime.

The reason you're doing this? Because you want the benefits of a REPL and the
benefits of using Vim (familiar environment, syntax highlighting, persistence,
...).

1. Usage				|slime-usage|
2. Screen Configuration 		|slime-screen|
3. Tmux Configuration			|slime-tmux|
4. Slime Configuration			|slime-configuration|
5. Slime Requirements			|slime-requirements|

==============================================================================
1. Slime Usage 					*slime-usage*

						*CTRL-C_CTRL-C* *<c-c><c-c>*
<c-c><c-c>		Send the  current paragraph text to screen/tmux. Slime
			will prompt for configuration if slime is not
			configured for the current buffer.

						*v_CTRL-C_CTRL-C* *v_<c-c><c-c>*
{Visual}<c-c><c-c>	Send highlighted text to screen/tmux.

						*CTRL-C_v* *<c-c>v*
						*:SlimeConfig*
<c-c>v			Setup slime to use screen or tmux. You will be
:SlimeConfig		prompted for information regarding how to target
			screen or tmux. See |slime-screen| or |slime-tmux| for
			more information.

						*:SlimeSend*
:<range>SlimeSend	Send a [range] of lines to screen or tmux. If no range
			is provided the current line is sent.


==============================================================================
2. Screen Configuration 			*slime-screen*

By default, GNU Screen is assumed, you don't have to do anything. If you want
to be explicit, you can add this line to your |.vimrc|:
>
	let g:slime_target = "screen"
<
When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted
for more configuration.

Screen session name~

This is what you put in the -S flag, or one of the line of "screen -ls".

Screen window name~

This is the window number or name, zero-based.

==============================================================================
3. Tmux Configuration 				*slime-tmux*

Tmux is not the default, to use it you will have to add this line to your
|.vimrc|:
>
	let g:slime_target = "tmux"
<
When you invoke vim-slime for the first time (see below), you will be prompted
for more configuration.

Tmux socket name~

This is what you put in the -L flag, it will be "default" if you didn't put
anything.

Tmux target pane~

A tmux pane can be targeted with any of the following values:
  - ":" means current window, current pane (a reasonable default)
  - ":i" means the ith window, current pane
  - ":i.j" means the ith window, jth pane
  - "%i" means i refers the pane's unique id

To get a list of all the available pane execute the following:
>
	tmux list-panes -a
<

==============================================================================
4. Slime Configuration 				*slime-configuration*

Global Variables~
						*g:slime_target*
g:slime_target		Set to either "screen" (default) or "tmux".

						*g:slime_no_mappings*
g:slime_no_mappings	Set to non zero value to disable the default mappings.

						*g:slime_paste_file*
g:slime_paste_file	Used to transfer data from vim to GNU Screen or tmux.
			This is required for screen and is set to "$HOME/.slime_paste" by default.
			For tmux it is optional; If not set, STDIN will be
			used. Setting this explicitly can work around some
			occasional portability issues.

Mappings~

Slime's default mappings can be overridden by setting up mappings in your
|.vimrc| like so:
>
	xmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeRegionSend
	nmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend
<

The following special plugin mappings are provided by slime:

  Used by the default mappings:
  <Plug>SlimeRegionSend		Send {visual} text. Use |xmap|.
  <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend	Send a paragraph. Use |nmap|.
  <Plug>SlimeConfig		Call |:SlimeConfig|. Use |nmap|.

  Optional mappings:
  <Plug>SlimeLineSend		Send {count} line(s). Use |nmap|.
  <Plug>SlimeMotionSend		Send {motion}. Use |nmap|.

Disabling a mapping is as simple as creating a mapping that does not exist,
for example:
>
	nmap <Plug>NoSlimeParagraphSend <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend
<

To use vim like mappings instead of emacs keybindings use the following:
>
	let g:slime_no_mappings = 1
	xmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeRegionSend
	nmap <leader>s <Plug>SlimeMotionSend
	nmap <leader>ss <Plug>SlimeLineSend
<

==============================================================================
5. Slime Requirements 				*slime-requirements*

Slime requires either screen or tmux to be available and executable. Awk is
used for completion of screen sessions.
